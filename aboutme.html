<p>Today, I will be writing about me. I am currently a senior at BECA. I plan on majoring in criminology and minoring in psychology. I really like baking and reading. My favorite thing to bake is chocolate cake. My favorite book series is The Inheritance Games and i recently finished the last book in the the trilogy. i am currrentky now reading Killing Insticts My goals for this year is to decide what colleges I would like to go. I would also lik,e to graduate in deceember. For colleges I'm still unsure but I hope to figure it  out in a few days where  would want to go. My top pick would be John Jay, seeing as I want to study criminology. I love collecting things. I love collecting squishmallows.I have over 35. I also collect erasers. all types of shapes and designs. I especially love the food ones that come apart.These things really add in the my personality.</p>
