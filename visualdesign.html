For this assignment, I used the tools to fill in the colors and the symmetrical tool, that helped with making it even. I started by being confused on what to make and eventually just started making random designs for the background. My characterâ€™s color scheme was inspired by Kirby. My character is wearing a purple donut. My character would be in a game that allows you to fight aliens. Their role would be to take over the city.
