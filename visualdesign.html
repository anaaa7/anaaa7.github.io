For this assignment, I used the tools to fill in the colors and the symmetrical tool, that helped with making it even. I started by being confused on what to make and eventually just started making random designs for the background. My character’s color scheme was inspired by Kirby. My character is wearing a purple donut. My character would be in a game that allows you to fight aliens. Their role would be to take over the city.

I used adobe express which was my first time using that software and it was pretty easy. I didn't really do anything except put photos that I believed matched the adjectives . I used photos from Pinterest that I think would go well together.  included pictures of bubbles because I am known to have a bubbly personality . I included a picture of birds coming out of a glass because it represents creativity which is something I connect to. I think the collage matches my aesthetic because it’ll have things I love like CDs which I’m really big on. It has New York  which I was born and raised in.
